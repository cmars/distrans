/// Initialize native platform-specific stuff.

/// veilid-core has android-specific code that assumes if you're running on
/// android, you're an app which has called
/// veilid_core::veilid_core_setup_android. And if you haven't, veilid-core
/// configuration will error out.
///
/// This assumption is not valid for the case of a command-line binary like this
/// one, when running on android though. Which is kind of a hacker thing to do
/// already, but it can be done with adb shell or termux.
///
/// To work around this, we can set up android with a new JVM instance and pass
/// null for the AndroidKeyringContext. That new JVM instance requires an
/// available libjvm -- which might need to be installed separately into the
/// android execution environment. The null keyring context could result in an
/// NPE in keyring-manager, so we'll also conditionally compile android to
/// always use an insecure keyring.
///
/// These are both hacks around some assumptions in veilid-core that could be
/// improved upon by refining the android-specific codepaths there.
///
/// Another option would be, a stigmerge Android library. That library could
/// handle the initialization the same way veilid-flutter does.
